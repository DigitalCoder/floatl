# Floatl

A library agnostic, pragmatic implementation of the [Float Label Pattern](http://mds.is/float-label-pattern/).

## Motivations

There are several libraries available which implement the Float Label Pattern, most notably [floatlabels.js](https://github.com/clubdesign/floatlabels.js) and [FloatLabel.js](https://github.com/m10l/FloatLabel.js). These libraries didn't quit fit the requisites I had in mind:

- Pragmatic approach
- Textarea support
- Customizable trough CSS
- No jQuery dependency
- Easy integration in Rails (with Bower and [rails-assets](https://www.rails-assets.org)

Furthermore I'd like to use a well-maintained library. Since we're using this library in production at [Cityspotters](https://www.cityspotters.com) I'm keeping this library up to date.
